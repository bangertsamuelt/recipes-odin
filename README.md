<h2>What is this project about?</h2>
<p>This project is a depiction of the HTML skills I have learned so far through The Odin Project's cirriculum.</p>
<p>In this project I showcased:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Setting up and HTML document using the HTML boilerplate.</li>
  <li>Using text in HTML (paragraphs, headers, bold words, and italicized words).</li>
  <li>Using tags and elements, of course!</li>
  <li>Using unordered and ordered lists.</li>
  <li>Adding images, links, and using multiple files.</li>
  <li>My ability to use Git and commit messages (made a small mistake in the beginning).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mistakes Were Made</h2>
<p>When learning any new skills, mistakes are bound to happen.</p>
<p>While working on this project I made a few minor mistakes, most of which I could fix. The one mistake I couldn't fix was my first commit. I didn't save my recipe pages correctly and committed with the message "Finish homepage and add html structure for recipe pages." Only the first half of that message was true. Once I realized I hadn't saved my recipe pages properly, it was too late to --amend my commit message. In the future, I will make sure that my files are saved and staged correctly before committing anything.</p>
<h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>
<p>I think I did a great job on this project. I was surprised at myself for retaining most of the information I learned without needing to refer to study material. This project was great practice, and I can't wait to learn and improve.</p>
