            <li>6 ounces provolone cheese, sliced</li>

            <li>6 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="med ziti">Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in large, heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook onion in oil until tender. Stir in rosemary and garlic. Transfer to a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Place ground beef and sausage in the skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Stir in the onion mixture and the spaghetti sauce. Season with salt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. In the prepared dish, layer 1/2 of the cooked pasta, provolone cheese, sour cream, cottage cheese, and a little less than 1/2 of the meat mixture. Then layer the rest of the pasta, mozzarella cheese, remaining meat mixture, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until heated through and cheeses are melted.</li>
        </ol>
